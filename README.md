"Itinerary Planner" is a simple React application designed for managing tasks that need to be completed before or during travels. Users can add, view, update, and delete travel tasks, demonstrating CRUD operations in React using Hooks.

View Tasks: Display all the tasks in a list.
Update Tasks: Users can edit the text of tasks in their list.
Delete Tasks: Users can remove tasks from their list.

### Technical Details

React Components: Functional components with hooks (useState, useEffect).
CRUD Operations: Implemented for travel tasks.
Input Validation: Prevents empty task submissions.
Styling: Uses CSS (or optionally, a CSS framework like Bootstrap) for simple and intuitive layout.
